EFI compatible vBIOS versions based on Apples own EG2 driver (extracted from different MacBookPro and iMac firmware).
Most native experience when using these EG2 versions, no glitches and no display sync problems. 
Needs an iMac firmware modification as described in the wiki.

Optimal choice for macOS only systems.

UEFI Windows support only with AMD GOP injection via OCLP.
